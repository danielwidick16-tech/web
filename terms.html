        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>

        <p>Welcome to Volcanic Heating & Air. By accessing our website (volcanichvac.com) or using our HVAC services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our website or services.</p>

        <p>These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and customers. We may update these Terms from time to time, and your continued use of our website or services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h2>Services and Website Purpose</h2>

        <p>Volcanic Heating & Air provides residential and light commercial HVAC services in Bend, Oregon and surrounding Central Oregon communities. Our services include heating and cooling system installation, repair, maintenance, and related work.</p>

        <p>Our website is intended to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide general information about our company and services</li>
          <li>Allow you to request service appointments</li>
          <li>Enable you to contact us with questions</li>
          <li>Share helpful HVAC information and tips</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The information on our website is for general informational purposes only. While we strive to keep it accurate and up-to-date, we do not guarantee that all information is complete, current, or error-free. Availability of services, scheduling, and pricing are subject to change and are not guaranteed until confirmed directly by our team.</p>

        <h2>Appointment Requests and Scheduling</h2>

        <h3>Requesting an Appointment</h3>
        <p>Our website allows you to request a service appointment through our online scheduling tool. Please understand that submitting a request is not a confirmed appointment. An appointment is only confirmed when you receive direct confirmation from our team (by phone, email, or text).</p>

        <p>We cannot guarantee specific appointment times or same-day availability. Appointment availability depends on technician schedules, service area, weather conditions, and other factors beyond our control.</p>

        <h3>Cancellations and Rescheduling</h3>
        <p>If you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, please contact us as soon as possible. We appreciate advance notice so we can offer the time slot to other customers.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We ask for at least 24 hours notice for non-emergency cancellations when possible.</li>
          <li>Same-day cancellations or no-shows may be noted in your account history.</li>
          <li>Repeated no-shows may affect future scheduling availability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arrival Times</h3>
        <p>We do our best to arrive within scheduled windows, but service calls can sometimes run longer than expected. If we anticipate being late, we will attempt to contact you. We appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>

        <h2>Estimates, Pricing, and Payment</h2>

        <h3>Estimates</h3>
        <p>We may provide estimates for HVAC work based on the information available at the time. Estimates are not binding quotes unless explicitly stated in writing. Actual costs may vary based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conditions discovered during the work (hidden damage, code issues, etc.)</li>
          <li>Additional parts or labor required</li>
          <li>Changes requested by the customer</li>
          <li>Access difficulties or site conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the scope of work changes significantly, we will discuss the updated pricing with you before proceeding.</p>

        <h3>Pricing</h3>
        <p>Prices listed on our website, if any, are for informational purposes only and are subject to change without notice. Final pricing will be provided on your invoice or written estimate. All prices are in U.S. dollars and may not include applicable taxes, permit fees, or other charges unless specifically stated.</p>

        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>Payment is typically due upon completion of services unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We accept common payment methods including cash, check, and major credit cards. For larger projects, we may require a deposit before beginning work.</p>

        <p>The final invoice governs all pricing matters. Any discrepancies between verbal discussions, website information, and the final invoice should be raised before payment.</p>

        <h2>Service Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>General Information Only</h3>
        <p>Information on our website about HVAC systems, maintenance tips, troubleshooting, and related topics is provided for general educational purposes. Every HVAC system and home is different. Do not rely on website information as a substitute for professional inspection and diagnosis.</p>

        <h3>No DIY Reliance</h3>
        <p>Any tips or information we share should not be interpreted as encouragement to perform HVAC work yourself. HVAC systems involve electrical components, gas lines, refrigerants, and other hazards that require professional training and licensing. Attempting DIY repairs can be dangerous and may void equipment warranties.</p>

        <h3>Results May Vary</h3>
        <p>HVAC system performance depends on many factors including equipment age, installation quality, home insulation, ductwork condition, usage patterns, and maintenance history. We cannot guarantee specific outcomes such as energy savings, temperature consistency, or equipment lifespan.</p>

        <h3>Equipment and Parts</h3>
        <p>Availability of specific equipment, parts, and brands is subject to supply chain conditions and may change. If a particular item is unavailable, we will discuss alternatives with you.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>To help us serve you effectively and safely, you agree to:</p>

        <h3>Provide Accurate Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Give us correct contact information and service address</li>
          <li>Describe the issue or service needed as accurately as possible</li>
          <li>Inform us of any known issues with your home or system</li>
          <li>Let us know about any previous work done on the system</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ensure Access</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be present (or have an authorized adult present) during the service appointment</li>
          <li>Provide access to all equipment that needs service (indoor and outdoor units, thermostats, etc.)</li>
          <li>Clear a path to the work area when possible</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pets and Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure pets during our visit so they don't interfere with work or escape through open doors</li>
          <li>Ensure the work area is reasonably safe and clear of hazards</li>
          <li>Inform us of any safety concerns (aggressive pets, unstable structures, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Permits and Approvals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some work may require permits from local authorities. We will advise you when permits are needed, but obtaining necessary approvals is ultimately the property owner's responsibility.</li>
          <li>If you live in a homeowners association (HOA) or rental property, ensure you have any required approvals before work begins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety and Site Access</h2>

        <h3>Work Area Conditions</h3>
        <p>Our technicians need safe access to perform their work. This may include access to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attics, crawlspaces, and basements</li>
          <li>Rooftops (for certain equipment)</li>
          <li>Utility rooms and mechanical closets</li>
          <li>Outdoor equipment locations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Access Limitations</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to decline or postpone service if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access is unsafe (unstable ladders, structural concerns, etc.)</li>
          <li>Weather conditions make roof or outdoor work dangerous</li>
          <li>The work area presents health hazards (excessive mold, pest infestations, etc.)</li>
          <li>There is no safe path to the equipment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If we cannot complete work due to access or safety issues, we will explain the situation and discuss options. You may be responsible for service call fees if we cannot perform work due to conditions at your property.</p>

        <h3>Property Conditions</h3>
        <p>HVAC work sometimes requires accessing areas that may have existing damage, wear, or fragile materials (older ductwork, aging insulation, etc.). While we take care to minimize disruption, we are not responsible for pre-existing conditions or materials that fail due to age or deterioration during normal service activities.</p>

        <h2>Warranty and Workmanship</h2>

        <p>Warranty coverage, if any, will be specified on your invoice, estimate, or separate warranty document. We do not make blanket warranty claims on this website.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manufacturer warranties:</strong> New equipment may come with manufacturer warranties. Terms and duration vary by manufacturer and product. We can help you understand what's covered, but the manufacturer's warranty document governs.</li>
          <li><strong>Workmanship:</strong> If we provide a workmanship warranty on our labor, the specific terms and duration will be stated in writing on your invoice or estimate.</li>
          <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Warranties typically do not cover damage from misuse, lack of maintenance, acts of nature, or unauthorized modifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please keep your invoice and any warranty documents for your records. Contact us if you have questions about warranty coverage for work we've performed.</p>

            <li><strong>Estimates can change.</strong> We do our best to give accurate estimates, but actual costs may differ based on what we find during the job.</li>
            <li><strong>Website info is general.</strong> Don't use our tips as a substitute for professional advice or attempt DIY work on HVAC systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Help us help you.</strong> Give us accurate info, make sure we can access your equipment, and keep pets secured during service visits.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety comes first.</strong> If we can't safely access equipment, we may need to reschedule or decline the job.</li>
            <li><strong>Warranties are in writing.</strong> Any warranty we offer will be spelled out on your invoice or estimate—not just on this website.</li>
            <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who is abusive to our team.</li>
